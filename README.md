    - [ ]  Let
    - [ ]  Also
    - [ ]  Apply
    - [ ]  Run
    - [ ]  With
    - Summary of Scope functions:
    let: Used to check nulls, also better than simple null check in multi-threading case
    also: same as 'let'  but it doesn't return the last line as 'let', instead 'also'  will return the object it was called on and 'not the last line!'
    apply: helpful function to modify objects, if you want to change in properties of the objects, and it uses 'this' instead of 'it' as we work inside the class of the object
    run: equivalent to 'apply', but it won't return the object it was called, instead it will return the last line
    with: same as 'run' but a different signature.
